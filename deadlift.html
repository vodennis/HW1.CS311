    <h2>The Deadlift</h2>
    <p>The deadlift is a lift that targets the posterior chain like the lower back,<br> 
        glutes, hamstrings, and traps. It is one of the most<br>
    effective exercises for building overall strength and power.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Stand with your feet around shoulder width under the barbell</li>
        <li>Grip the bar outside your legs</li>
        <li>Lower your hips and bend your knees until your shins close to or touching the bar</li>
        <li>Brace and keep your back straight and lift the bar up by driving through your heels</li>
        <li>Lockout using your hips until you are in an upright position then lower the bar back to the ground</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Common Mistakes</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Rounding your back during the lift</li>
        <li>Not locking out fully at the top of the lift</li>
    </ul>
