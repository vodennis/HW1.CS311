        <p>Powerlifting is a training style that revolves around the three main compounds: <strong>squat, bench, and deadlift.</strong> <br>
        Powerlifters try to maximize the amount of weight they can lift in all three of these compounds.<br>
        These three exercises are the foundation of strength training and are referred to as <em>The Big Three.</em><br>
